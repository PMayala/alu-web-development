                <p>I am Plamedi Mayala, a young Rwandan patriot, pursuing my bachelor's in Software Engineering at the African Leadership University. I find this journey interesting, having studied Mathematics, Physics, and Computer science in my advanced level at Ecole des sciences Byimana. My dream goal in this journey is to build solutions to real-world challenges by bridging technologies. I am all about impacting positively my community. </p>
                <p>The above is a picture of the most inspiring president alive, His Excellency Paul Kagame, the president of the Republic of Rwanda. Rwanda is derived from a Kinyarwanda word "Kwanda" which means "To Expand". In the last centuries, Rwanda wasn't looking as it is today on the map. It was more visible that everyone could notice it at first sight.</p>
